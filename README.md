# A04 — Advanced CSS: News-Style Portfolio Homepage

**Course Value:** 15%

## Overview
This project is a content-dense, responsive landing page designed in the style of a news homepage. It serves as a CSS mastery exercise, focusing on advanced layout, selectors, custom properties, and motion. The page can function as a personal portfolio or a fictional publication, showcasing both design and technical skills.

## Assignment Goals
- Work with a large amount of content on a single page
- Plan and implement a complex layout (sections, grids, featured areas, sidebars, etc.)
- Use CSS custom properties, advanced selectors, and motion (transforms, transitions, animations) intentionally
- Build a news-style layout suitable for a portfolio front page

## Teamwork
- Teams of three (trios) are assigned randomly in class
- All members share the same grade for A04
- Communication and collaboration are essential

## Instructions
- Rapidly design and build a static, responsive home page in a news-style layout
- The page should have a clear hierarchy (top stories, secondary content)
- Include multiple sections (e.g., Featured, Latest, Categories, Highlights)
- Thoughtful placement of text and images (not just a single column)
- Each team member must contribute at least two articles:
	- A tip, trick, or technique learned
	- A project or assignment to showcase
- Each article must include:
	- Author
	- Published date
	- Headline
	- Image
	- Excerpt
	- Body
	- Category
	- Tags
- Categories and tag system are defined by the group
- All content lives on a single, scrollable front page

## Requirements
- Fully responsive (320px to 1920px widths)
- Use at least 3 CSS custom properties (e.g., brand colors, spacing, font sizes, shadows)
- Include at least one of each:
	- CSS transition
	- CSS animation
	- CSS transform
- Use advanced selectors:
	- Descendant selector
	- Child selector
	- Adjacent sibling selector
	- General sibling selector
	- Attribute selector
- Use at least one pseudo-selector:
	- `:first-child`, `:last-child`, or `:nth-child()`
- Code should be clean, well-commented, and logically structured

## Evaluation
- **Code Quality (10 pts):**
	- 3+ custom properties
	- 5+ advanced selectors/combinators
	- 1+ pseudo-selector
	- At least one transition, transform, and animation
	- Clear formatting, comments, and logical structure
- **Design (5 pts):**
	- Page layout: hierarchy, structure, use of space
	- Article layout: readability, typography, rhythm
	- Responsiveness: works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Weighting:**
	- Team Evaluation: 40% (peer feedback)
	- Instructor Evaluation: 60% (code, design, requirements)

## Connection to A05
- In A05, you will individually refactor and extend this codebase
- Everyone must understand the code and leave it well-structured and commented
- Avoid letting one person do all the work; future assignments depend on shared understanding

## Team Formation
- Default: random trios assigned in class
- Accommodations: speak to the instructor if you need a different arrangement
