FLIP DEBUGGING GUIDE
====================

The flip wasn't working because of: type="module" in the script tag

FIXED: Removed type="module" from index.html line 349

HOW TO TEST:
1. Open index.html in browser
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. You should see:
   - "Ripple effects initialized on X elements"
   - "Tarot card flip initialized on 2 cards"

4. Click on a Featured Stories card
5. You should see in console:
   - "Card 1 flipped: true" (or Card 2)

6. Click again:
   - "Card 1 flipped: false"

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Front side shows: Title + Author + Date
- Back side shows: Full article with image + tags
- Smooth 3D rotation animation (0.8s)
- Card lifts slightly on hover

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you still don't see the flip:

1. Check Console for errors
2. Verify the cards have class "tarot-card"
3. Make sure CSS files are loading
4. Try the test-flip.html file (simplified version)

CSS FILES TO CHECK:
- styles/styles.css (lines 284-409)
- styles/responsive.css (lines 63-71)
